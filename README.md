# My-CodePen-Clone
My first React project â€“ a CodePen-inspired playground with live HTML, CSS, JS editing, dark/light mode, localStorage save, and code download as ZIP. Built using React, Vite, and CodeMirror. More features like templates &amp; live error console coming soon. Learned a lot through bugs &amp; fixes!
